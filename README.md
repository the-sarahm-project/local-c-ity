# local(c)ity

The geographically-friendly pub/sub hub for commuters and tourists alike!

Have you ever walked from point A to point B without having looked at your surroundings carefully? Have you ever wondered if you missed out on deals, or if there was possibly a great ramen restaurant in the area? As a small store-owner, have you ever wondered if your business model was attracting a certain type of audience, or any audience at all?

Worry no more! local(c)ity is a mobile application that aims to resolve these problems by allowing subscribed users to be pinged when they are geopgrahically close to the cuisine/store/locations they are interested in, so if you're on a walk to a new location - you might find out that you've got an Ippudo right around the corner.
